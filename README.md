# Neighborhood Map
This app is to demonstrate the ability to use a js framework (`knockout.js`) & Google Maps API.


## Features
A Google Maps implementation that shows you the best places (in my opinion) to visit around Canary Wharf, UK.
The site is fully responsive and will run on your tiniest screens all the way to the largest screen you can think of.
You get a full screen Google Map, populated with locations, along with a sidebar with a list of the locations that can be clicked on and also filtered so you can nail down what you want without any other distractions.

## APIs
Google Maps API is used here to show the map and generate the markers etc.
Foursquare API is used to pull more information on my favorite locations and provide a more complete listing when you click on the marker and the infoWindow shows up.

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open the index.html file.
